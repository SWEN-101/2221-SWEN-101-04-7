                <h4>EzShop is a team of five developers dedicated to creating tools with the purpose of streamlining consumer experiences within both local and chain businesses. Our current product “EzShop” is a tool created with the purpose of making shopping faster for consumers, while preventing any downsides to the company employing it. EzShop accomplishes this by monitoring shelved products and displaying their locations to customers on either digital screens placed throughout the store or on the customer’s own electronic device. This service prevents companies from losing profits from customers who purchase things they did not intend to buy when entering the store because customers are still required to walk to their intended product, past other products that they may decide to buy.
